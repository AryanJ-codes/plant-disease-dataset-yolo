# Intelligent Crop Disease Identification and Decision Support Framework

This project presents an intelligent, data-driven framework for detecting and classifying crop diseases from field images and providing actionable treatment recommendations.

The system integrates high-performance computer vision models with AI-driven decision support to assist early disease identification and farm-level decision-making.

## 🌱 Diseases Covered
- Apple Scab
- Potato Late Blight
- Corn Common Rust

## 🚀 Key Features
- Achieved **96–98% classification accuracy** on field-captured crop images
- Utilized **YOLO-NAS** for robust and high-speed disease detection across varying environmental conditions
- Integrated **ChatGPT APIs** to generate contextual, treatment-oriented recommendations
- Enabled early-stage disease identification to support data-driven agricultural interventions
- Designed with future extensibility for **AR/VR-assisted in-field diagnostics**

## 🧠 System Architecture
1. Image acquisition from field conditions
2. Disease detection and classification using YOLO-NAS
3. Post-processing and confidence filtering
4. AI-based recommendation generation via ChatGPT
5. Decision support output for farmers and agronomists
